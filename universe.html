        The Maraudersâ€™ universe is a magical world, the same as the Harry Potter universe. It explores different places, including bits of the muggle world in the view of wizards and witches. The characters are mostly Hogwarts students who wander in the large castle and search for the different secret passages found all across the building. There are various magical creatures in the wizarding world, feel free to find out about them :
